Simple easy practice backend built in flask to practice JSON file structures.
  
This would be easier to build out in SQL and would provide easier and faster way to store relations between entities

Clone github repository and then:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

'python -m flask run'

Flask's default port is 5000, so navigate to localhost:5000 in web browser.
